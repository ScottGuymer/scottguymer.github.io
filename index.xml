      <description>Any company of a decent size and age that creates software at any scale will have gone through a number of &amp;ldquo;technical evolutions&amp;rdquo;. These come along as you hire new people, create new products or just better ways of doing things come along. The kind of changes I&amp;rsquo;m talking about are the adoption of different technologies over time and the introduction of new ones. This cuts right across different aspects of software, from languages to frameworks to techniques to tooling.</description>

      <description>Software Design Patterns This is the basics. Every software developer needs to understand these things. Im far from saying that this book contains the only rules you should ever follow when creating software and using patterns. I think you need to mix and match these and other patterns to help you solve the problem. But having everyone know these basic patterns and be able to speak to them from the same context is a great thing.</description>
