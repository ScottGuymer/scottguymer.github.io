      <description>This week I attended the Azure Challenge in Leeds hosted by Microsoft at the Hilton Leeds City. This was a 2 day event focussing on Kubernetes in Azure. There was very little information about the format and content and it felt like it was being kept under wraps!
The only info we were given was
  Install the Azure CLI 2.0 Install Docker Install Kubectl Install Postman - this is optional but useful   I arrived a bit late and sat down with Team 8 that consisted of Lee Dyche, Paul Latham and David Betteridge.</description>

      <description>Any company of a decent size and age that creates software at any scale will have gone through a number of &amp;ldquo;technical evolutions&amp;rdquo;. These come along as you hire new people, create new products or just better ways of doing things come along. The kind of changes I&amp;rsquo;m talking about are the adoption of different technologies over time and the introduction of new ones. This cuts right across different aspects of software, from languages to frameworks to techniques to tooling.</description>

      <description>LINQ is amongst the greatest features of c# and when it was released people instantly took to using it. It forms the basis of may ORMs and other object manipulation tools. It can form a great abstraction when loading and manipulating data.
It can however like a lot of great tools be horrendously misused by a lot of people. I have seen 10+ line LINQ statements dropped into the middle of large blocks of business logic.</description>

      <description>Software Design Patterns This is the basics. Every software developer needs to understand these things. Im far from saying that this book contains the only rules you should ever follow when creating software and using patterns. I think you need to mix and match these and other patterns to help you solve the problem. But having everyone know these basic patterns and be able to speak to them from the same context is a great thing.</description>
