      <description>This week I attended the Azure Challenge in Leeds hosted by Microsoft at the Hilton Leeds City. This was a 2 day event focussing on Kubernetes in Azure. There was very little information about the format and content and it felt like it was being kept under wraps!
The only info we were given was
  Install the Azure CLI 2.0 Install Docker Install Kubectl Install Postman - this is optional but useful   I arrived a bit late and sat down with Team 8 that consisted of Lee Dyche, Paul Latham and David Betteridge.</description>
