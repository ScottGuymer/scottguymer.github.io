      <description>I only use Cloudflare for this blog so you can imagine I was quite surprised when I got an invite to their first European #internetSummit hosted in London. I signed right up and was pretty curious about the topics.
Compared to some conferences it was a simple single track conference that consisted entirely of panel discussions rather than your more traditional speaker/talk arrangement. This is by no means a bad thing at all.</description>

      <description>APM products aren&amp;rsquo;t part of your solution - they are part of your problem
 Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - they are for the most part great products and they do absolutely serve a purpose. But, as we move towards a much more distributed world with lots of smaller interconnected applications that are frequently updated and dynamically scaled, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that these traditional products are the solution. Certainly not in the product format they are in currently where you pay per &amp;ldquo;host&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;agent&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This week I attended the Azure Challenge in Leeds hosted by Microsoft at the Hilton Leeds City. This was a 2 day event focussing on Kubernetes in Azure. There was very little information about the format and content and it felt like it was being kept under wraps!
The only info we were given was
  Install the Azure CLI 2.0 Install Docker Install Kubectl Install Postman - this is optional but useful   I arrived a bit late and sat down with Team 8 that consisted of Lee Dyche, Paul Latham and David Betteridge.</description>
