Not just of docker images themselves, but also for artifacts that you might extract and use outside of the container.
When you are building Docker images security should be one of the concerns you can take care of in your CI piplien. This varies from simple linting of your dockerfiles using something like hadolint to a more complex scanner that can scan the internals of your images and give you some clues as to where you might need to address security concerns.</description></item><item><title>Docker as a build system - with Windows containers</title><link>https://www.scottguymer.co.uk/post/docker-as-a-build-system-windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 09:01:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.scottguymer.co.uk/post/docker-as-a-build-system-windows/</guid><description>Whilst I am familiar with linux containers I havent had the chance to use windows containers much so this is part of a series where I explore the features and differences of windows container. These posts are written for someone who is fairly new to the docker experience.
Docker doesnt just have to be used just to build, package and deploy applications. Its ability to provide an isolated environment that you have control over is great for build systems in general.</description></item></channel></rss>
